Error when robot picking object, some reasons is:
  - error in camera calibration, although the average total deviation in the working coordinate space of the robot is
    about 0.5%.
  - error in actual measurement to calibrate camera and control the position for robot.
  - error in robot calibration, the reference angles cannot be calculated with absolute precision.
  - intrinsic error in robot (structure of the robot).
  - error in object tracking algorithm
